# Note Down Bot

Hello ðŸ‘‹ #Notion users, I have made an alternative to getpocket.com but with #Notion

I have been using #Notion for the past 3 months, And now it is my go to app for writing & sharing notes/blogs.

With every information being stored in notion.
I also wanted to save informative twitter threads & articles that I find while surfing the internet. But without opening the notion app.

I wanted a feature very similar to WhatsApp forward. As this didnâ€™t exist natively in the app, I have built a solution around it.

With the help of the telegram bot, I have created a Notion integration to import any URL that is passed to this bot.

Simply share any URL to the telegram bot & it will be imported into your notion page.

Use the steps specified in the below link ðŸ‘‡, To set it up for your notion workspace.
